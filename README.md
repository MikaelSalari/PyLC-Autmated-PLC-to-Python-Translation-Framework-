# PyLC-Autmated-PLC-to-Python-Translation-Framework-
The initial version of the automated PLC to Python translation framework, PyLC with support of Function Block Diagram (FBD) language under IEC61131-3 standard. It consists of 4 different Python scripts, including PLCopen XML Parser, FBD Information Extractor, Python code generator, and unit testing-based translation validator.
You can start using the framework by importing an FBD program in the shape of a PLCopen XML file into script #1 and executing the script. The extracted info will be generated in a new Python file in the same directory. To build the code and make the necessary changes to the generated code, you need to execute scripts 2,3, and 4 one by one. The final result will be generated in a new Python file and include the translated FBD program in Python.
Please note that the tool is under development and the newer version with numerous improvements will be uploaded soon...
